# CellularGA

This repository contains a program created as part of a bachelor thesis at BUT FME. The aim of the thesis was to create a cellular automaton with rules generated by a genetic algorithm to find interesting behaviours and patterns.

## Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, you need to install the following libraries:

- **numpy**: For numerical operations and handling the cellular automaton grid.
  - Install with: `pip install numpy`
- **opencv-python**: For capturing and writing video frames of the simulation.
  - Install with: `pip install opencv-python`
- **pygame**: For rendering the cellular automaton simulation in a graphical window.
  - Install with: `pip install pygame`
- **matplotlib**: For plotting and saving graphs of simulation results.
  - Install with: `pip install matplotlib`

Ensure you have these libraries installed before running the scripts.
